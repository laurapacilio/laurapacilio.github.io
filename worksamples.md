## Blog Writing - Self-Driving Technology
---
<br>
At Aurora, part of my job involved writing stories demystifying self-driving technology for the public blog. For each, I met with engineering stakeholders to learn deeply technical concepts and collaborated with the marketing team to bring the story to life. Below are a few of my favorites.

## Technical Writing - HCP Packer
---
<br>
I led the development of all documentation for the HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) Packer Beta and General Availability launches. I worked with engineering and product marketing to make sure the content was technically accurate and aligned with our marketing messaging. I also acquired configuration examples and used them to test the product before launch.
and collaborated with the marketing team to bring the story to life. Below are a few of my favorites.
* **Written:** August 2021 - April 2022

## Technical Writing - recBoat User Manual
---

While in graduate school, I was contracted to work on a short-term project for a
research group at the National Robotics Engineering Center (NREC). The group
needed an operations manual for an autonomous research vessel called recBoat. I
met with the engineering team, learned the processes, and then worked with them
to acquire photographs that would illustrate the tasks. Below, I include an excerpt
from the manual.

* **Written:** September 2015
* **Audience:** recBoat users who have some prior experience and an intermediate level
of knowledge of boat operations
