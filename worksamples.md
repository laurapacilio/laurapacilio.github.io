## Blog Writing - B2B Software
---
<br>
I am responsible for all customer-facing copy at Stedi, which includes company blog posts. I worked directly with product management and the leadership team to draft the following post announcing that Stedi offers free, public EDI specifications for every X12 HIPAA transaction set. I also worked with the team to ensure the post furthers our marketing goals, including using this as an opportunity to demonstrate the value of our Stedi Guides product. I created all of the visuals for the post and drafted corresponding social media copy for the announcement.
* **Written:** February 2023
* **Audience:** Potential Stedi customers
