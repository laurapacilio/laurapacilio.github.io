I'm Laura, a Pittsburgh, PA native (go Steelers!) who loves hiking, gardening, reading, and (of course) writing. Fun fact: I skipped math my senior year of high school so I could squeeze in more English electives. My all-time favorite books continue to be Wuthering Heights and Brave New World.

## Why I love being a writer in tech

It started at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), where I was a Lab Manager orchestrating multi-stage research studies on stress, meditation, and smoking. A huge part of my job was learning complex tools (like an eye tracker) and procedures (like checking someone's breath carbon dioxide), and then teaching research assistants to execute these tasks flawlessly with hundreds of participants. As you can imagine, this involved *a lot* of in-person training and thorough documentation.

Then I learned that there were entire jobs that revolved around this type of work, and I was ecstatic. An entire career built upon learning cool new things and teaching them to others? Sign me up!

I immediately enrolled in CMU's Masters in Professional Writing program, specialized in scientific and technical content, and have been a professional writer ever since.

My role at each organization has varied. In my first job, I built an entire set of developer docs from the ground up. Later, I developed an internal engineering newsletter and helped engineers show the rest of the company why their work is awesome. I've written UI copy, blog posts, and step-by-step manuals.

I genuinely enjoy a challenge. There is nothing more thrilling than building from the ground up or figuring out how to solve a big, amorphous problem. I've also discovered that I'm happiest when I can help people. Sometimes that's engineering saying "Thank you! This is exactly what I was hoping for!" after I edit their work, and sometimes it's watching the relief on someone's face when I point them to well-written instructions.

Good content is invaluable in every industry, and tech is no exception. But communicating well in writing is hard. I'm proud to remove that burden so critical products, expertise, and ideas can make the most impact.
