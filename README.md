## About Laura

From software documentation to internal company newsletters, my greatest strength is distilling complex ideas and processes into clear and compelling content that streamlines work, drives alignment, and engages a wide range of audiences. Throughout my career, I've also enjoyed coaching non-writers, collaborating with product and design teams, and finding ways to bring technology to life.
