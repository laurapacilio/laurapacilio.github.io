## About Me
From software documentation to internal engineering newsletters, my greatest strength is distilling complex ideas and processes into clear and compelling content that streamlines work, drives alignment, and engages a wide range of audiences. 

## What is this?
This is my professional portfolio website where you can find samples of my work. In addition to being a functional portfolio, this site is meant to demonstrate that:
* I have experience writing Markdown and HTML by hand. 
* I can use version control systems. Check out my commit history!
* I have experience using the command line. I work on my website locally and use the command line to stage my changes, write commit messages, and then push my changes here to GitHub.
* I'm a fast learner who thoroughly enjoys the challenge of learning new tools and approaches. I chose to start with a basic Jekyll template and I'm slowly customizing it as I see areas for improvement. I could have purchased a pretty template with lots of dynamic elements already...but where's the fun in that?

I'm slowly customizing the theme and adding more content, so just know that it's a work in progress! Please reach out if you'd like to see additional samples or need further information.
