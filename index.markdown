# Technical Writer and Storyteller
From grant proposals to developer docs to blogs about self-driving cars, I've built my career around turning dense technical jargon into compelling content for a wide range of audiences.

It all started at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), where I was a Lab Manager for five years orchestrating multi-stage research studies on stress, meditation, and smoking. I routinely learned complex tools (like an eye tracker) and procedures (like how to check someone's CO2 levels) and taught research assistants to execute them flawlessly with hundreds of participants. As you can imagine, this involved *a lot* of in-person training and thorough documentation.

When I learned I learned that there were entire jobs that revolved around writing docs, I was ecstatic. An entire career built upon learning cool new things and teaching them to others? Sign me up!

I immediately enrolled in CMU's Masters in Professional Writing program, specialized in scientific and technical content, and have been a professional writer ever since. I love what I do, and I'm always looking for ways to grow as a technical communicator.
