# Technical Writer and Storyteller
From grant proposals to developer docs to blogs about self-driving cars, I've built my career around turning dense technical jargon into compelling content for a wide range of audiences. I also enjoy user research, working with subject matter experts, coaching non-writers, collaborating with product and design teams, and learning new tools.

I love what I do, and I'm eager to continue to grow as a technical communicator.
