# Technical Writer and Storyteller

I love learning about cool tech, explaining why it's awesome, and helping people use it. <br>

My specialty is turning dense technical jargon into compelling content for a range of audiences. I have **10+ years of experience** crafting clear and concise copy for instructions, blog posts, user interfaces, and websites. I *really* like working with developers, and I consistently build strong relationships across product and engineering to source and refine information.<br>

I've had the privilege of working for startups where roles are fluid, and each person is responsible for paving a path forward. That means I know how to multitask, handle uncertainty, work independently, lead projects from end-to-end, and manage setbacks gracefully. <br>

I love what I do, and I'm always looking for ways to grow as a technical communicator.
