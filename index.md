# Professional Writer, Storyteller, and Nerd

I'm a writer who loves learning about cool tech, explaining why it's awesome, and helping people use it to build things.

My specialty is turning dense technical jargon into compelling content for a range of audiences. I have **10+ years of experience** crafting clear and concise copy for instructions, blog posts, user interfaces, and websites. I *really* like working with developers and digging into the underlying technology. I consistently build strong relationships across product and engineering to source and refine information.

I've also worked at startups where roles are fluid, and each person is responsible for paving a path forward. That means I know how to multitask, handle uncertainty, work independently, lead projects from end-to-end, and manage setbacks gracefully.  

I love what I do, and I'm always looking for ways to grow as a technical communicator.
