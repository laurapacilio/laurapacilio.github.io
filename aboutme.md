<br>
I'm a Pennsylvania native (go Steelers!) who loves hiking, gardening, reading, and (of course) writing. My all-time favorite books continue to be Wuthering Heights and Brave New World.

Fun fact: I skipped math my senior year of high school so I could squeeze in more English electives.

## How I became a professional writer

It started at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), where I was a Lab Manager orchestrating multi-stage research studies on stress, meditation, and smoking. A huge part of my job was learning complex tools (like an eye tracker) and procedures (like checking someone's breath carbon dioxide), and then teaching research assistants to execute these tasks flawlessly with hundreds of participants. As you can imagine, this involved *a lot* of in-person training and thorough documentation.

Then I learned that there were entire jobs that revolved around this type of work, and I was ecstatic. An entire career built upon learning cool new things and teaching them to others? Sign me up!

I immediately enrolled in CMU's Masters in Professional Writing program, specialized in scientific and technical content, and have been a professional writer ever since.

My role at each organization has varied. In my first job, I built an entire set of developer docs from the ground up. Later, I developed an internal engineering newsletter and helped engineers show the rest of the company why their work is awesome. Throughout my career, I've written UI copy, blog posts, step-by-step manuals, overview pages, documentation templates, and more. I'm always looking to expand my experience to new content types.

## Why I love my job

I genuinely enjoy a challenge. There is nothing more thrilling than building from the ground up or figuring out how to solve a big, amorphous problem. The tech space offers a lot of these types of opportunities.

I also like that good content helps people. It helps leaders express their ideas clearly. It helps people showcase their incredible ideas. It helps people excel at work. For example, I love imagining the relief on users' faces when they find a well-written article that fixes their problem.

Finally, working in tech is just *so cool*. I've had the privilege of writing about some of the most transformative topics and products of our generation. Contributing to those efforts is amazing. It makes me excited about the future.
