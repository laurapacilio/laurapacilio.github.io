<br>
I'm a Pennsylvania native (go Steelers!) who loves hiking, gardening, reading, and (of course) writing. My all-time favorite books continue to be Wuthering Heights and Brave New World.

Fun fact: I skipped math my senior year of high school so I could squeeze in more English electives.

## How I became a professional writer

It started at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), where I was a Lab Manager orchestrating multi-stage research studies on stress, meditation, and smoking. A huge part of my job was learning complex tools (like an eye tracker) and procedures (like checking someone's breath carbon dioxide). Then, I taught research assistants to perform these tasks flawlessly with hundreds of participants. This process involved *a lot* of in-person training and thorough documentation.

Then I learned that there were entire jobs revolving around this type of work. An entire career filled with learning cool new things and teaching them to others? Sign me up!

I immediately enrolled in CMU's Masters in Professional Writing program, specializing in scientific and technical content, and I've been a professional writer ever since.

Each role has brought new opportunities to expand my skills. In my first job, I built an entire set of developer docs from the ground up. I didn't know anything about writing software, so I sat on my couch late at night watching videos about databases and reading about APIs. I loved it.

In a later job, I developed an internal technical newsletter and helped engineers tell the rest of the company why their work is awesome. I loved that, too.

Throughout my career, I've written UI copy, blog posts, step-by-step manuals, overview pages, documentation templates, and more. I am always excited about trying new types of content, and I'm still expanding my portfolio.

## Why I love my job

I genuinely enjoy a challenge. There is nothing more thrilling than figuring out how to solve a big, amorphous problem. The tech space offers a lot of these types of opportunities.

I also like that good content helps people. It helps leaders express their ideas clearly. It helps people showcase their incredible ideas. It helps people excel at work. For example, I love imagining the relief on users' faces when they find a well-written article that fixes their problem.

Finally, working in tech is just *so cool*. I've had the privilege of writing about some of the most transformative topics and products of our generation. My work preserves my sense of wonder and makes me excited about the future.
