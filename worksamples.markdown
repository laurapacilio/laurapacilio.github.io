# Self-Driving Blog Posts
Part of my current role involves developing stories demystifying self-driving technology for Aurora’s public-facing blog. For each, I meet with engineering stakeholders to learn deeply technical concepts and collaborate with our marketing team to bring the story to life. Below are a few of my favorites.
* **Written:** October 2019 - May 2020
* **Software:** N/A
* **Audience:** Prospective Aurora hires and an educated lay audience

#### Read them on Aurora's website:

# Updating the Lab Website
When I worked as a Lab Manager at Carnegie Mellon University, I managed every part of the lab’s day-to-day operations from training research assistants to creating study materials to ordering lab supplies. When I left to become a Technical Writer, I wrote a manual for my replacement to reference throughout their ﬁrst few months. I’ve included a short excerpt from the Lab Manager Manual  that describes how to update our lab website using Adobe Dreamweaver.

* **Written:** April 2016
* **Software:** Google Docs
* **Audience:** Lab members who were assumed to have no prior knowledge of Dreamweaver or web design

# recBoat User Manual
While in graduate school, I was contracted to work on a short-term project for a
research group at the National Robotics Engineering Center (NREC). The group
needed an operations manual for an autonomous research vessel called recBoat. I
met with the engineering team, learned the processes, and then worked with them
to acquire photographs that would illustrate the tasks. Below, I include an excerpt
from the manual.

* **Written:** September 2015
* **Software:** Microsoft Word
* **Audience:** recBoat users who have some prior experience and an intermediate level
of knowledge of boat operations

# XMind User Assistance
Mind mapping is a way of organizing information and ideas visually, and XMind was one of the leading mind mapping software programs on the market when I took Carnegie Mellon University's Software Documentation course. My team and I learned to use XMind and conducted a content audit of XMind's current user assistance as well as a competitive analysis comparing XMind's user assistance to that of two mind mapping competitor softwares.

We then created a comprehensive online information center that provided user assistance for the main functionality in each of XMind's three versions: Basic, Plus, and Pro. Below are some of the topics that I was responsible for writing. Note that each sample was authored in DITA.
