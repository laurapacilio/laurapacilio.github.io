# Self-Driving Blog Posts
Part of my current role involves developing stories demystifying self-driving technology for Aurora’s public-facing blog. For each, I meet with engineering stakeholders to learn deeply technical concepts and collaborate with our marketing team to bring the story to life. Below are a few of my favorites.

# Updating the Lab Website
When I worked as a Lab Manager at Carnegie Mellon University, I managed every part of the lab’s day-to-day operations from training research assistants to creating study materials to ordering lab supplies. When I left to become a Technical Writer, I wrote a manual for my replacement to reference throughout their ﬁrst few months. I’ve included a short excerpt from the Lab Manager Manual  that describes how to update our lab website using Adobe Dreamweaver.

* **Written:** April 2016
* **Software:** Google Docs
* **Audience:** Lab members who were assumed to have no prior knowledge of Dreamweaver or web design
