# Where it all started
It all started in the Psychology department at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), where I was a Lab Manager for five years orchestrating multi-stage research studies on stress, meditation, and smoking. A huge component of that job involved learning complex tools (like an eye tracker) and procedures (like how to check someone's CO2 levels) and teaching our research assistants to do these things flawlessly with hundreds of participants. As you can imagine, this involved lots and lots of thorough and clear documentation and eventually, a few grant proposals and research papers.

When I learned I could get a job doing those things full time, I was ecstatic. I graduated from CMU
with a Masters in Professional Writing in 2016 and I've been a professional writer ever since!
